      <h2>Overview</h2>
         <p>The project will consist of both a mobile and web application that would appeal to all age groups, focusing on app usability and efficiency to retrieve, store, track, and analyze user data. The aim of the project will be to help individuals who may be suffering from mental health issues, as well as reducing the mental health disparities in countries around the world. Both the mobile and web apps will be a platform where groups and individuals can seek help and track their progress for their mental health. Ultimately, the project requires several different non-technical individuals to help develop the app, such as psychologist, psychotherapist and user experience designer to create an attractive interface for the user. </p>


      <h2>Motivation</h2>
         <p>More people are staying home more than ever during the coronavirus pandemic, albeit with their family, friends or by themselves. This raises an issue, which is how quarantine and the effects of the pandemic is affecting the mental health of people. According to the Journal of Medicine, the effects of public health emergencies on individuals and communities such as confusion, emotional isolation, and owing to economic loss “may translate into a range of emotional reactions”, such as distress and psychiatric conditions (Pfefferbaum and North 2020, p.510). In addition, it is estimated that 20.1 percent of Australians had a “mental or behavioral condition” in 2017 to 2018 (Cook 2019, para. 6).  Providing easy access for help to people through web and mobile applications is an effective way to reduce mental distress, especially in places that don’t have available therapists or where people are unable to afford an in-office therapy session.</p>

         <h2>Description</h2>
         <p>One of the first things that should be visible on the first page of the app is identifying the type of user that is seeking help. For example, individuals, couples, teens and children (under parental guidance), and businesses. This ensures that the app targets individuals and groups in society that are most prone to mental health. Once users has identified themselves in the category they fit in most, it will lead to a questionnaire that asks a series of questions regarding the demographic, psychographic, and geographic of the user such as Gender, Age, Relationship status, Religious and spiritual beliefs, Experience with counseling and therapy, Location, Preferred Language, etc. To add on, the survey would include questions regarding symptoms that may lead to anxiety, depression, and other mental problems. There will be an optional test for users to take such as the personality test or Big5 Test for counselors to gain insight on user’s personality and history to better help them. <br><br>  

         Other features would include elements like an efficient navigation bar that includes a FAQ, advice, reviews, about, and login page. For users that are data sensitive and wanting to feel more secure about their information, the mobile app will implement a facial recognition feature for all IOS devices with a front camera. After signing up and login in, the app will ask the user the type of counselor they would prefer and their expertise in fields such as depression, relationships, family conflict, trauma and abuse, and the like. The reason for this type of psychological testing is “to quantify and parse apart symptoms that are shared among disorders" where people may have several symptoms (Tartakovsky 2018, para. 12). Furthermore, the testing is to identify the type of help the users are seeking and to redirect them to a counselor best fit for their issue.  <br><br>  
            
         The next feature is a 1-on-1 session through online communication. The user can choose to communicate through a messaging room or a live chat session with their chosen counselor. The live chat session will be private and would require a passcode to enter for added security.  <br><br>  
            
         Another feature is a journaling space. This function provides a space for people to create journal entries. Within the journal entry, users can type, record, insert photos, and draw, allowing them to express their thoughts in different ways. The journal space will include an in-app scanner for journals that are handwritten, giving a choice for users who prefer to handwrite their journals but still want to log it into the app.  <br><br>  
            
         The app also includes guided therapeutic exercises. The exercises are a form of meditation through breathing and visualization. Users can choose the type of exercise and the duration of 5, 10, 15, or 30 minutes. A reminder feature is available for users to set daily, weekly, or monthly reminders.  <br><br>  
            
         Lastly, to cover the costs of counsellors and therapists, there will be subscription base of $30 weekly payments to access the full features of the app. Users can pay through PayPal, credit card, MasterCard, or AfterPay.  </p>

         <h2>Tools and Techonology</h2>
         <p>1.) For Front-end development, two software will be used. Firstly is “Framework 7", which is a mobile and web development framework using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript to develop IOS and Android apps.
              <!--https://framework7.io/   -->
         <br><br>
         2.) For the website, I will use ‘'VSCode’' Text editor to program for the front-end and back-end of the website. Specifically, the HTML and CSS will be written in VSCode. For the JavaScript, ‘'buildfire.js’' will be used.  

         <!-- https://code.visualstudio.com/ 

         https://buildfire.com/  -->

         <br><br>
         3.) For user interface design, “Animator By Haiku” will be used to create animations, geared towards children and teenage users of the app.  
         <!-- https://www.haikuforteams.com/animator/  -->

         <br><br>  	   
         4.) Back-End Development: MySQL, which is an open-source relational database software will be used to manage user information.  

         <!-- https://www.mysql.com/ -->

         <br><br>
         5.) Pigeon paywall, a plugin used to set up a paywall for paid content. 
         <!-- https://pigeonpaywall.com/  -->
         </p>

         <h2>Skills Required</h2>
         <p>The skills required for building website and mobile application are HTML, CSS, and JavaScript using Framework 7. There are various accredited courses and masterclasses online where HTML, CSS, and JavaScript can be learned and are taught by experience individuals. To use Animator by Haiku, some knowledge on digital design would be required. Knowledge of user centered design is required for researching demographics and psychographics of users to identify their needs. Additionally, knowing how to program in PHP required to use MySQL for managing user record. </p>

         <h2>Outcome</h2>
         <p>A successful project means launching it on the App Store and Google Play Store, giving many smartphone users the access to the app. In addition, the website will also be available to reach more internet users.  
         <br><br>
         This project solves the original problem of people unable to go to in-office counselling due to the high cost of therapy of $100-$150 per hour, in comparison to $30 weekly subscription. The impact it would have on people’s mental health would be tremendous as more people are willing to get counselled due to the available access to help.  
         <br><br>
         Beyond using websites and mobile apps as platforms, the project could move to therapy and counselling sessions via Virtual Reality. They may be effective in helping people experiencing face-to-face in-office counselling.  </p>
