               <p class="lead">Hey! My name is Youthtakak Mam, feel free to call me YT. I'm in the Monday tutorial at 15:30. This website is for Assignment 1 in Introduction to Information Technology (COSC1078) at RMIT. <br><br>

               <span class="primary-text"> Fun Fact:</span> I have been stuck in Phnom Penh since the pandemic hit Melbourne and unable to return back to Melbourne until further notice. However, it’s not too bad here and I am still able to grab a few drinks at a bar. I speak Khmer and English.

         <h2><span class="primary-text">More</span> About Me</h2>
         <p>I’ve always been a physically active person growing up, so I enjoy outdoor activities. Particularly, I enjoy football (soccer) and have been playing it for as long as I remember.CS:GO is the only game I play whenever I want to let out some steam. For music, I'm into a variety of genres such as pop, alternative/ indie rock, hip/hop, and jazz to name a few. So if we're ever in a car together, don't hand me the AUX cord because my playlist can get a little hectic! </p>
         <h2><span class="primary-text">Education</span></h2>
         <p>
          I finished high school in mid 2018 in Phnom Penh, Cambodia. In the same year in October, I attended Deakin University in Melbourne, Australia, undertaking the Diploma of Commerce for a year. After, I took a gap year and applied for the Bachelor of Information Technology at RMIT.

            <h3>My Interests</h3>
            <p>The concept surrounding Information Technology is new to me. My skills and knowledge regarding the process and procedures behind computational operations has yet to improve. What sparks my interest and curiosity in this field is how people can create products and services seemingly impossible before, such as self-driving cars, 3D printing, or AI. At the start of year 2020 was when my interest in IT started. In Cambodia, the use of emerging technology is at the beginning stages. There was no event that sparked my interest, however, driving around Phnom Penh, the capital of Cambodia, I began to envision how technology can be used to solve the everyday problems within the city. Another reason for my interest in IT is that there will most likely be an increase demand for jobs in the future for computer science and IT specialists, making it a lucrative job. In addition, the growth in the technology sector and the information technology sector will likely be exponential for years to come. Due to ITs worldwide recognition, businesses and organizations are always looking for a way to improve their operations therefore there is high job security and I won’t have to worry about a lack of IT related jobs.</p>

            <h3>Why I chose RMIT </h3>
            <p>RMIT is a top 1% of university in the world and a place of high-quality education where I can learn from the best Computer Science and Information Technology experts. It is an ideal place for further education in this field as it is recognized for innovation in technology and design, with a strong focus on emerging trends. In addition, the course structure favours my learning outcome as it allows me to explore the different streams of IT before directing my focus towards a specific major. Furthermore, job skill workshops and networking sessions provided by RMIT are a great way for me to develop both technical and soft skills to prepare for industry-related work. To add on, there is a large student body at RMIT therefore I feel like it is essential for my growth to engage and learn with people with different cultures, backgrounds, and experiences. Ultimately, these are my reasons for choosing RMIT.  </p></div>

            <h3>Expectations</h3>
            <p>I expect to learn different programming languages, project management, and using software development tools to create a service or product. Aside from learning the technical skills, I expect to learn how to manage time and projects effectively, collaborate and work productively in teams and with other individuals. Furthermore, by the end of the course, I should know how to identify future trends and have knowledge of the process of create sustainable products and services for the IT market. Since we are currently in the era of the Fourth Industrial Revolution, innovative technology is constantly emerging, I hope to learn the hard skills and soft skills to successfully identify and solve twenty-first-century problems with modern solutions to improve communities and enrich people’s lives. </p></div>
